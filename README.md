# ReminderAPP
### **Overview:**
#### Introduction:
RemindMe is a very simple reminder app. I can be used for small one-time reminders like assignments, quizzes, and other small tasks. I was made while keeping simplicity and user friendliness in mind. Use of image buttons makes it very easy to use even if a person does not know to read.
####	Motivation:
In student life it is difficult to keep track of tons of assignment deadline and quizzes. Primary motivation for this project is similar, being a student, we have burden of too many assignments and sometimes we forget to do an assignment or to submit an assignment. We needed a reminder app that is very simple and useful. Secondary purpose was to make app that is useful for a person who does not know to read.
####	Similar Apps:
There are several apps task reminder apps available for this purpose but they are not that much simple and provide a couple of other features that we do not need.
### **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**
There are several apps available that provide many advance features for reminding functionality like repeating, sharing, snooze, simple and detail text. All these features are good but not for a preson who is not geeky. There comes remind me a very simple app for one time reminders. It uses image buttons which makes UI attractive and simple to use even for an illiterate person.
